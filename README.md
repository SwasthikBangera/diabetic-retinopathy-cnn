# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection CNN

## Project Overview
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is graded on a 5-class severity scale (where 0 = No DR, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe & 4 = Proliferative DR). The goal is a production quality CNN classifier using EfficientNet-B4 with transfer learning, focal loss for class imbalance and Grad-CAM heatmaps for clinical explainability which are all tracked via MLflow.
